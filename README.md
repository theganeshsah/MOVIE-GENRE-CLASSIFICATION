# MOVIE-GENRE-CLASSIFICATION

Exited to share the project on movie genre classification using machine learning!
This project involved data preprocessing, feature extraction, and training machine learning models to predict genres accurately.
Key highlights: 
ðŸ”¹ Used Python and popular libraries like scikit-learn and TensorFlow for model development.
 ðŸ”¹ Analyzed movie plot summaries and extracted key features for classification. 
ðŸ”¹ Achieved [mention your evaluation metrics in predicting movie genres, e.g., accuracy, F1-score].

CSV data size is more than 40 mb so unable to uplod in github you can download this dataset from kaggle
