# MOVIE-GENRE-CLASSIFICATION

#### This project is focused on developing a machine learning model that predicts the genre(s) of a movie based on its attributes (like title, description, or metadata). The main goal is to classify movies into one or more genres using supervised learning techniques.

### Movie genres can help users find relevant films based on their interests. This project builds a machine learning pipeline that classifies movies into genres. The model utilizes movie metadata and potentially other textual data to predict one or multiple genres for a given movie.

# Key goals:

### Create a dataset with relevant features for training.
### Preprocess the dataset for machine learning models.
### Train a classifier that predicts the movie genre(s).
### Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using appropriate metrics.

# Dataset
### The dataset contains movie metadata (title, description, release year, etc.), and the target labels are the genres. The dataset might be sourced from popular movie databases such as IMDb, TMDB, or MovieLens.

# Features used in the project:

### Movie Title
### Description
### Year of Release
### Cast/Crew (optional)
### Other metadata (if applicable)
### Data Preprocessing
### The project involves preprocessing steps like:

# Text vectorization (e.g., TF-IDF, word embeddings)

# Data cleaning (removal of stopwords, tokenization)

# Encoding labels for multi-class classification.

# Model Training

# The core of the project involves training machine learning models such as:

### Logistic Regression
### Random Forests
### Support Vector Machines


# You can adjust the model parameters and techniques in the Jupyter notebook to experiment with different algorithms and configurations.

# Evaluation
### The models are evaluated using metrics such as:

### Accuracy
### Precision
### Recall
### F1-score
AUC (Area Under the Curve) for multi-label classification.
The notebook also contains plots and visualizations for performance evaluation.

# Usage
### After training the model, you can use it to predict the genre(s) of a new movie. The code for making predictions is available in the notebook.




# This project involved data preprocessing, feature extraction, and training machine learning models to predict genres accurately.
#Key highlights: 
### ðŸ”¹ Used Python and popular libraries like scikit-learn and TensorFlow for model development.
### ðŸ”¹ Analyzed movie plot summaries and extracted key features for classification. 
### ðŸ”¹ Achieved [mention your evaluation metrics in predicting movie genres, e.g., accuracy, F1-score].
